        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>Im a 20 year old coder in training, I have no prior experience in coding but through this course i hope to acquire the skills and contacts needed to have a bright career in coding. 
        I became interested in coding through gaming, a few friends and i have hopes of becoming programers and eventually creating our own video game.
        I am certified in other fields such as construction, landscaping tech, and culinary arts.
        I wish to continue to further add to my collection of certifications to further improve my profile.
        Afterall a well versed entrepeneur will never be without work.
        </p>
